Currently I work at [Claymore Game Studios](https://claymore-games.com/) on the next entry in the long standing "Commandos"-Series.

One of my personal projects is a hopefully more comprehensive documentation of Unreals AnimNodes. You kand find the documentation on my personal website [over here](https://www.aaronkemner.com/)
